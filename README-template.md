## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Jquery](https://jquery.com/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned how to implement jQuery with JavaScript, which helped me code faster. My JavaScript code is lengthy and more complicated, but I am satisfied with it for now. However, I know that JavaScript code can be made less lengthy.

### Useful resources

- [Jquery](https://jquery.com/) - The jQuery documentation helped me a lot when I was stuck somewhere.
